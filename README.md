requirments:- support all new broswers

Project Notes:- a simple day-planner will allow employees to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT they can manage my time effectively
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

Setup:- git clone https://github.com/mazamim/day-planner.git
